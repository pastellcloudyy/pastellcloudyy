slowly working on read.me and sp remake.. ue ðŸ§€ðŸ˜­
- please do not cover me, only if you're someone I know
- c+h only with permission
- I might give permission to take inspo off my ocs, some ocs are a big no-no for inspo (example, main ocs)
- simular to the last one, please don't copy my skins
- IWC when I'm with my friends as I have a high chance I'll ignore you
- easly overwhelmed and may not talk much then, unsure what the cause of this is
- horrible and I mean HORRIBLE memory, trust me if I did smt I forget almost immediately

  once again spam follow dni unless friend, may also block you if you're not my vibe or on my dni
